I've moved my blog to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/stiemannkj1/stiemannkj1.gitlab.io) because I'm concerned about [Github's New Community Guidelines](https://github.com/blog/2267-introducing-github-community-guidelines). I've contacted GitHub about my concerns. Their response was essentially that users may be banned for "hate speech" or "harassment" which are both ill-defined and subjective. GitHub would not even guarantee that they would contact me before banning my account or repos or that I would be able to petition them if I believe the charges are false. I would like to be able to tackle controversial topics on my blog without GitHub banning me or my repos on a whim, so I moved to GitLab which will hopefully be more friendly to that goal.

This repo [now generates simple redirects via javascript to the corresponding blog page on stiemannkj1.gitlab.io](https://github.com/stiemannkj1/stiemannkj1.github.io/blob/master/_includes/redirect.html).
