[A group of protesters recently shut down Donald Trump's rally in
Chicago.](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/how-bernie-sanders-supporters-shut-down-donald-trump-s-rally-n537191)
Afterwards, Trump tweeted the following:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The
organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First
Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!</p>&mdash; Donald
J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a
href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/708619775153475584">March 12,
2016</a></blockquote>

This tweet demonstrates that Trump does not understand the First Amendment.
While it may be disturbing that a presidential candidate has fundamentally
misunderstood the Constitution, it is not really surprising because many
Americans don't grasp the purpose of the First Amendment either.

People often correctly state that the First Amendment codifies the right to
"freedom of speech." However, the phrase "freedom of speech" has been used so
often out of context that people have forgotten that it is simply an an
abbreviation for the actual text of the First Amendment. [The First Amendment
states:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment)

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or
of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
the government for a redress of grievances.

In simple terms, the purpose of the First Amendment is to restrict the
**government** from stopping people from speaking or assembling etc. "Freedom
of speech" or to "peaceably... assemble" (as written in the First Amendment) is
not the freedom to say whatever whenever wherever. Instead, it is the freedom
to say whatever whenever wherever without **government** censorship. The First
Amendment only protects people from the government. 

Trump's rights or the rights of some of his supporters may have been violated
in Chicago, but it was not their First Amendment rights which were violated
because the government did not attempt to restrict or censor his speech or his
rally. This situation is reminiscent of [the Phil Robertson
controversy](http://www.ew.com/article/2014/05/23/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson-antigay-sermon-video)
where A&E censored Robertson because of his views on homosexuality. [Many
conservatives complained that Robertson's First Amendment right to free speech
had been
violated](http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/duck-dynasty-anti-gay-republican-defense)
despite the fact that the government was not involved in any way. Speech in a
privately owned place may be suppressed by private individuals without
violating the First Amendment. Likewise people may peaceably protest another
peaceable public assembly without violating the First Amendment. Finally, even
if the situation turns violent between the two groups, as it did in Chicago, no
one's First Amendment rights have been violated unless the **government**
restricts those rights.
