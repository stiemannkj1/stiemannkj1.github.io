Chicago.</a> Afterwards, Trump tweeted the following: <!-- Note: the blockquote

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who
shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized
America!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a

This tweet demonstrates that Trump does not understand the First Amendment.
While it may be disturbing that a presidential candidate has fundamentally
misunderstood the Constitution, it is not really surprising because many
Americans don't grasp the purpose of the First Amendment either.

People often correctly state that the First Amendment codifies the right to
"freedom of speech." However, the phrase "freedom of speech" has been used so
often out of context that people have forgotten that it is simply an an
abbreviation for the actual text of the First Amendment. <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment"
target="_blank">The First Amendment states:</a>

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of
the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the
government for a redress of grievances.

In simple terms, the purpose of the First Amendment is to restrict the
**government** from stopping people from speaking or assembling etc. "Freedom of
speech" or to "peaceably... assemble" (as written in the First Amendment) is not
the freedom to say whatever whenever wherever. Instead, it is the freedom to say
whatever whenever wherever without **government** censorship. The First
Amendment only protects people from the government.

Trump's rights or the rights of some of his supporters may have been violated in
Chicago, but it was not their First Amendment rights which were violated because
the government did not attempt to restrict or censor his speech or his rally.
This situation is reminiscent of <a

target="_blank">the Phil Robertson controversy</a> where A&E censored Robertson
because of his views on homosexuality. <a
href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/duck-dynasty-anti-gay-republican-defense"
target="_blank">Many conservatives complained that Robertson's First Amendment
right to free speech had been violated</a> despite the fact that the government
was not involved in any way. Speech in a privately owned place may be suppressed
by private individuals without violating the First Amendment. Likewise people
may peaceably protest another peaceable public assembly without violating the
First Amendment. Finally, even if the situation turns violent between the two
groups, as it did in Chicago, no one's First Amendment rights have been violated
unless the **government** restricts those rights.
